        <h3>Which battle in the European Theater played the greatest role in the outcome of the war? Why?</h3>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                D-Day was the battle in the European Theater that had the greatest effect on the war. It happened on
                June 6, 1944. This is because of the planning that went into D-Day, the size of the offensive side,
                and the fact that they were able to actually overpower the German defense.

                D-Day was planned for 2 years. The allied side planned this long because of how important they knew
                it would be. Some things they could not plan for though, like bad weather. Their invasion was delayed
                24 hours because the weather was deemed too unsafe to attack.

                The second reason that D-Day was so successful was because of the size of the offense. There were
                11,000 airplanes and 5,500 boats. 156,000 soldiers landed on the first day. On June 30th, 875,000
                troops had invaded.

                The third and final reason that D-Day was so successful and important was that the Allied side had a
                successful invasion. Because the Allied side spent so much time planning and gathering resources,
                this gave them a large advantage. These advantages paid off when the Allied side was able to pull of
                the invasion
