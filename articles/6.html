                The Treaty of Versailles caused many problems in World War 2. Some issues that were created are that
                it gave Germany a reason to unite and the Treaty of Versailles did not actually fix any of the things
                that caused the first World War.

                When the Treaty of Versailles was written, it was written to hurt Germany. Because it was written to
                blame everything on Germany, this gave Germany a common enemy, everyone else. Now that Germany had a
                common enemy, someone was able to lead the country in a much stronger way.

                The Treaty of Versailles was written to blame everything on Germany, so it did not focus on solving
                any problems from the first World War. The same political issues and territorial issues that existed
                before the war existed during World War 2
