        <h3>Which cause of WWII had the most significant impact on the outbreak of the war? Why?</h3>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                The main reason Hitler started the War was because he believed in the Aryan race, meaning a race that is
                superior to any other. He thought that war was the only way of acquiring land to expand this
                “superior race”. On September 1, 1939, he attacked Poland. Poland had the military back up of Great
                Britain and France incase Germany decided to attack them, when Hitler signed the German-Soviet
                Nonaggression Pact they all went into a frenzy and started WWII.

                Hitler was using drastic measures to make sure he got the Aryan race and in doing so he was hurting
                many others, for the good of those people more countries got involved. The main group that was
                attacked were the Jews. Hitler believed they were to blame for everything that happened during and
                after WWI and made concentration camps, also known as death camps, to make them seem like they were
                less than human. Other countries did not like as he was using stolen land to build most of these
                camps, and they did not like what he was doing to the people.

                Hitlers main goal off eliminating people with different beliefs  turned out to be his own downfall,
                since during his last moments in power all he did was send all of his armies to finish off what he
                had started.
