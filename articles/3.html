        <h3>Which battle in the Pacific Theater played the greatest role in the outcome of the war? Why?</h3>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                The attack on Pearl Harbor was the most important battle in the Pacific because it got
                the United States into World War 2 and it destroyed Pearl Harbor.

                Soon after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the United States decided to join the second
                World War. This majorly affected the outcome of the war because one of the world’s
                largest superpowers joined this war. The United States joining World War 2 helped
                cause D-Day.

        <div class="block">
            <p>
                The second reason that the attack on Pearl Harbor was the most important battle is that
                this attack destroyed Pearl Harbor. When Japan planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, they
                planned to keep the United States from joining the second World War.
