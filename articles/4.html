        <h3>What role did the Holocaust play in the war? Why should we study and remember this event in history?</h3>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                As said earlier the Holocaust was a major event during WWII where jewish people all around Europe
                were systematically wiped out and imprisoned by the Nazis. But what role did this have in the war?
                After their loss in WWI Hitler blamed the jews for the loss and started the Holocaust as part of his
                campaign to take over Germany by giving the already angry people a common ally.  As the war went on
                people all around the world heard the shocking stories of the death camps the jews were put into.
                Towards the end of the war Germany got frantic as the allies were pushing in to finish afraid they
                would not be able to create their aryan race they quickly moved jews inwards and started executing
                them on death marches which made the allies angrier and more determined. The holocaust could have
                been stopped earlier if the allies didn't let the nazis keep taking but in the end the resources
                spent by germany and the anger caused by it led to their defeat anyway.
