        <h3>How did Germany's access to land and resources precipitate this war?</h3>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                While fighting in the war Germany was still fueling the Holocaust which was taking a lot of their
                resources and should have made them lose earlier but they had so many resources and so much land they
                didn't need to. At the start of the war Germany invaded many places and captured the land and people
                giving them a massive advantage but since they were already in not great economic state a lot of the
                stuff they captured had to go back home instead of to the troops. This constant increase in resources
                allowed them to quickly gain more power and allow them to continue the war and Holocaust.
