            Why did Americans allow Japanese internment to happen? Why should we study and remember this event in
            history?
        </h3>

                After Pearl Harbor was attacked and destroyed in 1941, The American government was afraid that there
                were more spies than what they had accounted for and passed Order 9066, which approved the relocation
                of Japanese-Americans into internment camps. The relocation was voluntary at the beginning but when
                not enough Japanese-Americans “turned themselves in” they started making it mandatory and many
                Japanese-Americans of first generations and second generation were losing their belongings. They were
                forced out of their homes and shoved into the camps.

                Many people in the camps were offered to work for the American Military to prove their loyalty for
                their country, many of them accepted just so that they could get their lives back, some of them had
                to fight their own family who were across the globe. This caused a lot of rifts between the families
                and their culture, even after the war was over people could not get their normal lives back because
                their stuff had either been sold or stolen.

                Due to this President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9742 on June 25, 1946. EO 9742 ordered
                the liquidation of the War Relocation Authority and allowed Japanese-Americans to return to their
                homes. Even when they returned they still faced discrimination and prejudice, they weren't able to
                get jobs or homes to keep their families alive. President Harry Truman was very ashamed of the past
                acts and  tried to compensate the people by paying tribute to all the Japanese-American veterans.

                All of this teaches us that some mistakes, even if other people think they are for the best or to
                protect others, still cause harm. Sometimes people exaggerate something, and it affects many others,
                and they don't notice it because they aren't the ones affected. You should always know that everyone
                has had their hardships and just because someone of that group or religion did something, it doesn't
                mean everyone else will.
