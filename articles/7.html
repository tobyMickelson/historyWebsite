                Germany was furious after their loss in WWII and basically destroyed. When Hitler took over he
                decided to blame the jewish people for the defeat and as part of his campaign Hitler blames the jews
                and starts the Holocaust which is the systematic genocide of the jews. Another sign of total war is
                how so many countries were using everything in their power all over Europe unlike other wars were
                battles would be in a few places and countries could survive loss in WWII. Defeat meant near
                destruction for your country. Another reason was just the pure scale of the war with over 50 nations
                and all over Europe battles were fought with all of them pouring resources into the war. One thing
                that was unheard of in other wars was the massive civilian casualties either from the introduction of
                large long range explosives or to purposeful killing in no other war where so many civilians were
                killed.
